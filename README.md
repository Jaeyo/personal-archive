> Personal-Archive keeps track of things you learn / discover everyday!

## Why?

I face tons of articles every day. Via googling or RSS or email newsletter or blog. Among them, some useful article go into Pocket or Instapaper, but I didn't bring them out again. I completely forgot.
Oh, I thought I needed to organize these things. I had to sort out the important ones and sort them properly so that I could find them again later. I looked for a suitable tool for me, but nothing found. So I made it.
